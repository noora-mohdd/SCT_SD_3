# Skillcraft Technology Internship â€“ Task 3: Sudoku Solver

Welcome to my internship task repository!  
This repository contains **Task 3** assigned during my internship as a **Software Development Intern** at **Skillcraft Technology**.

This task focuses on enhancing my programming, problem-solving, and software development skills through a real-world coding challenge: building a **Sudoku Solver** in Python.

##  Task 3: Sudoku Solver

This Python program automatically solves standard **9x9 Sudoku puzzles** using a **backtracking algorithm**.  
It reads an unsolved puzzle from a text file, fills in all the missing numbers (`0` for empty cells), and prints both the **unsolved** and **solved** versions to the console.

## Features

-  **Automatic Puzzle Solving**  
  Uses recursive backtracking to solve any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.

-  **Formatted Grid Display**  
  Prints both the unsolved and solved puzzles clearly in the terminal.  
  Empty cells are shown as dots `.` for better readability.

-  **Text File Input**  
  Puzzle input is loaded from a file (`puzzle.txt`) for convenience.

-  **Sample Output Image Included**  
  A screenshot of the program output is included in the project (`output.png`) to showcase how the puzzle looks before and after solving.
